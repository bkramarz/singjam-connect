          false for them. The panel sits directly under the date/location strip
          either way, so the tier list and its prices get the first screenful.
          Around it the map and the description trade places by breakpoint:

            wide    tickets | map        narrow   tickets
                    description                   description
                                                  map

          The split is at md, not sm: at 640px the map got squeezed to 192px
          beside the 384px panel, too narrow to show any context.

          One flex container with per-breakpoint `order` does that with a single
          map in the DOM. Rendering it twice and hiding one would be simpler to
          read and would cost a second Google Maps load on every desktop view,
          which is billed. DOM order is the wide one; `order` rewrites it below
          md. The panel carries no order class, so its implicit 0 keeps it first
          in both. `basis-full` is what breaks the description onto its own
          line when the row is wrapping. */}

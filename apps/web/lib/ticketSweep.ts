//
// The webhook is the only thing that fulfils an order, so a delivery that never
// lands leaves the buyer paid, unticketed, un-emailed and off the guest list —
// and neither existing sweep can see it. sweepUndeliveredTickets looks for
// `paid` orders with no email, and reconcileTicketAttendance for `paid` orders
// with no seat; a lost webhook leaves the order `pending`, so it is invisible
// to both.
//
// Worse, we actively close it off. expireStaleTicketHolds marks any lapsed
// `pending` order `expired`, so within ten minutes of the hold running out the
// order stops looking pending at all. **That is why this runs before it** — see
// the ordering in netlify/functions/flush-email-outbox.ts, which is load-bearing
// rather than incidental.
//
// It was never observed in production, and the live webhook has since been
// proven in both directions. This exists because the confirmation page now
// tells a buyer "You're in!" the moment Stripe confirms, which is right for
// them but removed the symptom that would have made a lost webhook obvious.
//
// Stripe is the authority here, not us: an order is only fulfilled when Stripe
// itself reports payment_status 'paid'. Fulfilment goes through the very same
// fulfilPendingOrder the webhook calls, whose `.eq("status","pending")` guard
// makes a double delivery a no-op — so this racing a late webhook is safe.

/**
 * What to tell a buyer on the confirmation page.
 *
 * The page is reached by Stripe's return_url the instant a payment is
 * confirmed, but fulfilment is the webhook's job and lands a second or two
 * later. Keying the page off our own order status therefore showed "Confirming
 * your payment…" to someone who had just handed over their card details, with
 * no way out but to refresh by hand. Observed live: the page rendered 37
 * seconds before the webhook arrived, and then sat there.
 *
 * The fix is that nobody needs to wait for our webhook to learn whether the
 * card went through — Stripe already knows at redirect time. So a pending order
 * whose session Stripe reports as `paid` is shown as paid. The webhook remains
 * the only thing that fulfils (issues the email, seats the buyer); this only
 * changes how fast the buyer is told.
 *
 * `payment_status === "paid"` is the exact test, and it is deliberately not
 * `status === "complete"`. A delayed-notification method — a bank debit, some
 * BNPL — completes its session while the money is still in flight, and those
 * are genuinely pending. Keying off session status would tell such a buyer they
 * were in before the payment had actually cleared.

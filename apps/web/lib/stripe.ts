// key set, including CI and Netlify. Same shape as supabaseAdmin() for the same
// reason. (lib/resend.ts can get away with module-level construction only
// because Resend tolerates an undefined key.)

// from ticket checkouts specifically rather than disabled account-wide — the org
// may still want it elsewhere. Klarna was the one actually surfacing; affirm and

// ticket prices, so they are excluded for the same reason.
//
// This is the supported way to narrow the offering. Never reach for
// payment_method_types — that would disable dynamic payment methods entirely and
// freeze the list at whatever we hardcode.
// A payment method configuration that lists ONLY what we want on a ticket
// checkout. Set STRIPE_TICKET_PM_CONFIG to a pmc_… id to use one.
//
// Why this exists on top of EXCLUDED_PAYMENT_METHODS: excluding a type keeps it
// off the session — verified, the session's payment_method_types really does
// come back without klarna — but the Payment Element was still showing Klarna
// and a bank option to buyers. The account's default configuration has klarna
// and affirm switched on, and the Element appears to render from that rather
// than from the session's narrowed list. Naming a configuration removes the
// discrepancy at the source instead of subtracting from it afterwards.

// Unset is safe: the session falls back to the default configuration with the
// exclusions below, which is exactly today's behaviour.

// at minute 29 could land after the sweeper released the stock and resold it:
// money taken, no ticket, and the webhook's `.eq("status", "pending")` silently

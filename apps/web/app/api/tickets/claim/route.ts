// The OAuth callback and the signup route already do this inline, but plain
// email-and-password sign-in goes through neither: it calls Supabase directly
// from the browser and routes onward. Someone who already had an account,
// bought a ticket without signing in, and then signed in with their password
// would otherwise never have it attached. This is the hook for that path.
//
// Safe to call on any sign-in: claiming is idempotent and does nothing when
// there is no unclaimed guest order under the address.
